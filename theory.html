        <!-- ================= MICROWAVE THEORY ================= -->
        <div class="card workbench-card">
            <h2>Microwave Transmission</h2>
            <p>
                Microwaves are electromagnetic waves in the frequency range of <b>1 GHz to 1 THz</b>.
                In <b>Computer Networks</b>, microwave transmission is widely used for <b>long-distance wireless
                    communication</b> because it supports <b>high data rates</b> and requires <b>no physical cable</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Microwave communication works mainly on the principle of <b>Line-of-Sight (LoS)</b>, which means the
                transmitting and receiving antennas must be able to "see" each other without any major obstruction.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Microwave Communication</h3>

            <h3>1. Terrestrial Microwave</h3>
            <p>
                Terrestrial microwave communication uses <b>ground-based towers</b> with parabolic dish antennas.
                The signal is transmitted in a straight line from one tower to another, usually with the help of
                <b>repeater stations</b>.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frequency Range:</strong> Typically 4–6 GHz, 11 GHz, 18 GHz, 21–23 GHz bands.</li>
                <li><strong>Transmission Type:</strong> Line-of-Sight (LoS).</li>
                <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> High bandwidth, suitable for high-speed data, voice, and video.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> No cables required, fast deployment, high data rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Affected by rain, fog, and obstacles; requires tall towers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Satellite Microwave</h3>
            <p>
                Satellite communication uses an <b>artificial satellite</b> orbiting the Earth as a repeater.
                The earth station sends a signal to the satellite called the <b>uplink</b>. The satellite amplifies it
                and sends it back to another earth station called the <b>downlink</b>.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Very large area (can cover entire countries or continents).</li>
                <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Long-distance communication without many repeaters.</li>
                <li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> High propagation delay and high initial cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Typical Lifetime:</strong> 12–15 years.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- ================= INFRARED THEORY ================= -->
        <div class="card workbench-card" style="border-top-color: var(--primary-magenta); margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2>Infrared (IR) Transmission</h2>
            <p>
                Infrared waves are electromagnetic waves with frequencies between <b>300 GHz and 400 THz</b>.
                In computer networks, infrared is mainly used for <b>short-range communication</b> inside a room.
            </p>

            <p>
                Infrared communication is also a <b>Line-of-Sight</b> or reflected communication and behaves similar to
                light.
            </p>

            <h3>Characteristics of Infrared Communication</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short Range:</strong> Works only over small distances.</li>
                <li><strong>High Security:</strong> Cannot penetrate walls, so signals stay inside a room.</li>
                <li><strong>High Data Rate:</strong> Supports very high bandwidth.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Affected by sunlight, dust, smoke, and obstacles.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Common example: <b>TV remote control, wireless mouse, short-range sensors</b>.
            </p>

        <!-- ================= CN CONCEPTS ================= -->
        <div class="card workbench-card" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
            <h2>Important Concepts in Wireless Communication (CN)</h2>

            <h3>1. Line of Sight (LoS)</h3>
            <p>
                Line of Sight means there must be a clear, unobstructed path between transmitter and receiver.
                Microwave and Infrared both mainly require LoS communication.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Noise and Interference</h3>
            <p>
                Noise is any unwanted signal that disturbs the original signal. Interference occurs when multiple
                signals overlap. Both reduce signal quality and data rate.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Path Loss</h3>
            <p>
                Path loss refers to the reduction in signal strength as the signal travels through space due to
                distance, absorption, and obstacles.
                In microwave systems, path loss increases with <b>distance and frequency</b>.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Bandwidth vs Frequency</h3>
            <p>
                Higher frequency bands generally support <b>higher bandwidth</b> and <b>higher data rates</b>, but they
                also suffer from <b>higher attenuation</b> and require better Line-of-Sight conditions.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Propagation Delay</h3>
            <p>
                Propagation delay is the time taken by a signal to travel from sender to receiver.
                Satellite communication has a <b>large propagation delay</b> because the signal travels thousands of
                kilometers to space and back.
